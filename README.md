# GenericRepositoryUoW
ASP.NET MVC Generic Repository with Unit of Work 

## Why do we need Unit of Work

We will design a basic infrastructure using Generic Repository and Unit of Work enterprise design patterns. We will develop the code first approach by using Entity Framework during design. Our infrastructure will be ORM independent

### Prerequisites

```
Visual Studio 
MSSQL Server
```

### Installing

We need to set Data Source address in Web.Config if we do not have sql server on our system.  
```
.\SQLEXPRESS
```
And you can build your DB with that command on Package Manager Console.
```
Update-Database
```
Then you can Debug and browse on
```
localhost:44386/
```
